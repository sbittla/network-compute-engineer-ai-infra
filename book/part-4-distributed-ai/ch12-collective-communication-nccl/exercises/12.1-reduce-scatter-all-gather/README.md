# 12.1 — Reduce-scatter and all-gather compose to all-reduce (★, L1)

**Type:** Knowledge check · **Kind:** computed · **Points:** 4

## Prompt

<!-- prompt:start -->
**12.1 ★ L1.** State the contract of reduce-scatter and of all-gather, and show that composing them
yields all-reduce. *Evidence required:* two definitions and a 2-rank example.
<!-- prompt:end -->

## Before you start

- **Chapter:** [manuscript.md](../../manuscript.md); every exercise prompt is also in [exercises.md](../../exercises.md).
- **Defaults:** Unless the prompt says otherwise, use the ORION values in [docs/REFERENCE_CLUSTER.md](../../../../../docs/REFERENCE_CLUSTER.md); the lab data is in [lab/data/](../../lab/data/).
- **Checking your work:** Check units and orders of magnitude against the chapter's worked examples. After you have your own answer, compare it with [outputs/expected/](outputs/expected/README.md): the reference script's output (`result.md`), the worked solution (`answer.md`) and the marking scheme (`marking.md`).

## What to submit

Put your deliverables in `outputs/` in this folder:

- `outputs/answer.md`: formula → substitution → result with units and evidence labels
- `outputs/work.py`: optional: a script that reproduces your numbers

Show every formula, substitution and result with units, and label each number with its evidence label.
